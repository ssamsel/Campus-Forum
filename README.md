### Innovative Idea ###
UMass Amherst is one of the largest campuses in the northeast, 
as a result it is often hard to know all that is going on around campus. 
That is why we have chosen to develop a campus forum where students can 
easily make posts about thinks going on and be able to interact with the post.
Often students receive email about events going on but in an email its not possible
to have a discussion about the event nor see how popular the event is.
