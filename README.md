### Innovative Idea ###

UMass Amherst is one of the largest campuses in the northeast, 
as a result it is often hard to know all that is going on around campus. 
That is why we have chosen to develop a campus forum where students can 
easily make posts about thinks going on and be able to interact with the post.
Often students receive email about events going on but in an email its not possible
to have a discussion about the event nor see how popular the event is.

### Data ###

The four types of data our application will use are:  
1. Images
    - Users will be able to post images to start a thread
    - These images will be previewed on the front page and expanded when the thread is opened
2. Captions/Questions for images
    - Each image posted must have some sort of description/caption/question
    - The text will be displayed alongside the image
3. Comments on a thread/image
    - Comments can be posted in response a thread/image
    - They will be sorted by order of posting and can reply to other comments
4. Likes to a comment/thread/image  
    - Users can upvote/like any comment/thread/image
    - The number of likes will be displayed next to a button to like the element
    - The count/button will be alongside the element
